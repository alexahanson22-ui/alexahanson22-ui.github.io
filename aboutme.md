My name is Alexa Hanson. I am from Philadelphia, PA where I live in a Anthropologie-esque rowhome complete with our 16-year-old cat Oreo. I enjoy rowing, running, discovering new coffee shops, and clothing. I am a senior majoring in political science and on the (super fun!) job hunt for next year. 

### My background

I have no experience in computer science, but I have worked for fashion brands in the past, including [Malia Mills](https://www.maliamills.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorYRXstch9DfLI1Q529CKdOw9Es5D6d03I9wETu5-xKHlAL-mn0), [Gramercy Atelier](https://www.gramercy-atelier.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopR7hP_HprL60gj5B2RpEQZiWFKBeW4AJPmRvImV8bNjmHaPfV2), and [Adam Lippes](https://adamlippes.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorlvU8dN-u4ciAbji_E2Ayps3bTnkaEOESG794nhwjPwyZFls6Y). I have learned to sew intermittently, most notably in a 5th grade arts and crafts camp, but my great-grandma was a seamstress and would be ashamed of my skills. CS 103 is a step in the right direction to learn more about textiles and sewing.
