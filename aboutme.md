My name is Alexa Hanson. I am from Philadelphia, PA where I live in a Anthropologie-esque rowhome complete with our 16-year-old cat Oreo. I enjoy rowing, running, discovering new coffee shops, and clothing. I am a senior majoring in political science and on the (super fun!) job hunt for next year. 

### My background

I have no experience in computer science.
