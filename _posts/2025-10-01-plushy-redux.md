In this project, I practiced creating variables (int btn and int swt) to set up the code that will run. I used if statements and print statements to make it run, and practiced using the terminal.

A tip I would use is to fully understand the scanf function first, because I initially thought I would use it for this assignment, but I didn't end up using it. It would have saved me time.

## This is the output.
