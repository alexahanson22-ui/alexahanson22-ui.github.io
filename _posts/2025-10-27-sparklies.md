In this project, I combined the past few Sparklie sub sections for the flash, fade, and synchronous and changed the timer variable names to create the flashing patterns. 

A hint is that using the cheat sheet that Iris gave us is very helpful in helping debug and using different syntax to be succinct (like bool).
