In this project, I first practiced creating circuits with a battery and an led that had two breaks in it, which could then be connected to either turn on or off the led. I created a paper prototype that I then practiced with alligator clips and then sewed onto my sewing sampler. My two switches were the paper clip and two pieces of conductive thread.

A tip I would say is to layer stitches of conductive thread if I want to create a point for the paper clip to touch - I didnt do this at first and it was much more difficult to get the switch to work.

## Here are pictures of my finished work, as well as the alligator clip stage.
