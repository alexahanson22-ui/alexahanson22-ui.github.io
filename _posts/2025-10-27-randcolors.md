In this project, I learned how to create a loop that only occurs when the button is pressed and has one output per press that is a combination of brightness and colors that are translated to the LED. I also practiced using booleans to tell the lilypad that the led goes on when the button is pressed. 

A hint is that starting with pseudocode and then filling in is very helpful. Also the use of booleans. 

## The output
