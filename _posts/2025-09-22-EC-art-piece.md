I am attaching code and an image that were created in C. I had inspiration from this website: https://www.asciiart.eu/animals/cats.

Here is the code snippet '''// (c) 2025 anh2, CS103
// EC Assignment: Hello, ASCII Art

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf(" /\\_/\\\n");
    printf("( o.o )\n");
    printf(" > ^ <\n");
    return 0;
}
