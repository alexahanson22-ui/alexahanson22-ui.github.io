In this project, I used a state-based approach to turn on an LED on the Arduino LilyPad to mimic a blinking pattern, as if it was a firefly flashing its lightbulb. I practiced using a timer and delay and displaying the voltage.

A hint is to test the "high" and "low" voltage on the pin to make sure it aligns with the blinking pattern first.
