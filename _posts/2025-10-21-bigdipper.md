In this project, similar to a fade program, the program increases the brightness of an LED until its max brightness where it then turns off. I used booleans as well as the interval, timer, and fade amount and timeupdate variables.

A hint is to clearly explain what each variable is doing in the pseudocode when defining it, which will make it easier to write the loop and the rest of the code.
