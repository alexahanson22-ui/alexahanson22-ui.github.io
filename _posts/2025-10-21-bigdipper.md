In this project, I used a state-based approach to a synchronous flashing pattern with every 10 seconds in a series of 3 flashes. I had to use inphase and endphase variables to make it work, as well as a timer and interval and delay.

A hint is to use booleans as much as possible in the if else statements because that will be the magic trick to make it work.
