Here is my plushy assignment. We were practicing how to create circuits and use conductive thread, because we will have to learn that down the line. First, we practiced prototyping on a worksheet where we learned to only connect negative charges with each other and positive with each other. Then, we sewed on the battery and the button and the switch and the LED onto the plushy with conductive threat and the running stitch. After that, we used regular thread to embroider and use whipstitch to complete the plushy. We left a 1 inch opening to stuff the plushy and then sewed it up. 

One tip is that I would be sure to read through all the instructions in advance, because that saves a lot of time. This isn't a hint, but it is important to be as clean as possible with the thread, and have tight and separate stitches. I learned this the hard way, because my circuit and lights were working, but then when my plushy got jumbled, some of the stitches moved and the circuit stopped working because the conductive thread was not connected tightly enough with the conductive button and switch and charged LEDs.
