Here is my plushy assignment. We were practicing how to create circuits and use conductive thread, because we will have to learn that down the line. First, we practiced prototyping on a worksheet where we learned to only connect negative charges with eachother and positive with eachother. Then, we sewed on the battery and the button and the switch and the LED onto the plushy with conductive threat. After that, we used regular thread to embroider and use whipstitch to complete the plushy. We left a 1 inch opening to stuff the plushy and then sewed it up. 

One tip is that I would be sure to read through all the instructions in advance, because that saves a lot of time.
