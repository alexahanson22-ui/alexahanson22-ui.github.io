title: Ghost Detector
subtitle: Simulating a ghost detector with temperature and light sensors that detect a ghost when it is both "cold" and "dark"

In this project, I learned how to use the temperature sensor and the light sensor on the arduino lilypad. I practiced syntax work, including booleans, and used the float syntax when trying to convert to decimals. 

A hint is to use Iris's examples for the conversions for decimals and float. That was very helpful.

## The outputs
