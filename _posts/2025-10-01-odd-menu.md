This is the project that creates a menu in C, where you first print to choose an integer that will show either the regular or the secret menu. The secret menu is shown for odd integers. Then, from there, I used nested ifs and boolean terms to have the user see the meal options and select which meal they prefer. If it is invalid, that is shown in the output!

A tip I would use from now on is to use the terminal to run my code because I will run into fewer problems.

## This is the output.
