Here is a C-program where I practiced conditional statements, which consist of if...then and also else, and if else. Depending on temperature, my program will output a statement to describe the appropriate weather gear. I decided to set the temperature to 70, so it is going to say what the best gear is for that temperature. A tip or hint I would tell myself is that the integer that I set the temperature to is what the program will assume is the temperature... I got a bit confused with that.
