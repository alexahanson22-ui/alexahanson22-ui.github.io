My name is Alexa Hanson. I am a senior Political Science major at Williams and I am on the crew team. I have worked in fashion for many years, but I have usually been on the business side so I do not have much sewing experience. I am interested in learning more about programming, considering my only experience has been STATA and a high school class dedicated to mobile app development. I am excited about CS because, as Prof. Howley has described, it is a subject that welcomes mistakes. A boring fact is that I am from Pennsylvania.

## Here is me angry on my seventh birthday, to practice putting an image on here.
